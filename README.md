CS010 607: Operating Systems Lab


Objectives
•	To provide a practical exposure of all algorithms and behaviour of processes in the system with respect to all its timings.
•	This lab also explains the allocation of process in the memory with some memory management techniques.

(Implement the following on LINUX platform. Use C for high level language implementation)
1. Basic UNIX commands
2.  Shell programming
- Command syntax
- Write simple functions with basic tests, loops, patterns
3. Write programs using the following system calls of UNIX operating system: 
       	fork, exec, getpid, exit, wait, close, stat, opendir, readdir
4. Write programs using the I/O system calls of UNIX operating system (open, read, write, etc)
5. Write C programs to simulate UNIX commands like ls, grep, etc.
6. Given the list of processes, their CPU burst times and arrival times, display/print the Gantt chart for FCFS and SJF. For each of the scheduling policies, compute and print the average waiting time and average turnaround time
7. Given the list of processes, their CPU burst times and arrival times, display/print the Gantt chart for Priority and Round robin. For each of the scheduling policies, compute and print the average waiting time and average turnaround time
8. Implement the Producer – Consumer problem using semaphores.
9. Implement inter-process communication using shared memory.
10. Implement some memory management schemes
